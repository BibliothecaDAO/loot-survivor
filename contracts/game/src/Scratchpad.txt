Scratchpad

- Finished the market item duplicate bug
-- I'm still not happy with the market item randomness as there is really only 6 market variants
-- Need to figure out a way to pick 20 random numbers between 1-101

What do we need for mainnet?
- Jewlery
- Prevent equip when market is open to prevent players from putting all their + charisma gear on, buying items, then swapping back
-- With this model, players who want to take advantage of their Charisma boosts will need to equip those items prior to leveling up which adds more difficulty
- Integrate Beasts ERC721
- Code clean up / remove/complete all TODOs
- Add 60 more obstacles

// Max action per turn

// Jewlery Abilities
